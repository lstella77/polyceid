  CEID order 0 run:

    ../../src/PolyCEID/PolyCEID input01_o0 >& output01_o0.dat

  CEID order 5 run

    ../../src/PolyCEID/PolyCEID input01_o5 >& output01_o5.dat

  To visualise the effect of resonant electron-ion coupling, open gnuplot and
  type:

    p './positions_run01_o0.dat' u 1:($4-$3) t 'CEID 0' w lp lt 1, './positions_run01_o5.dat' u 1:($4-$3) t 'CEID 5' w lp lt 3

  This way you can see the effect of the quantum fluctuations of the ions on
  the average distance between the central atoms (arbitrary units).
  CEID 0 is equivalent to Ehrenfest Dynamics, i.e., classical ions. The CEID 5
  dynamics already show the modulation of this classical (adiabatic)
  oscillations due to the non-radiative (quantum) decay to a lower electronic
  state. 
  The non-radiative electronic decay can be better visualised by plotting the 
  electronic population of the initially occupied state (HOMO-1 to LUMO+1 
  excitation):

    p './populations_run01_o0.dat' u 1:7 t 'CEID 0' w lp lt 1, './populations_run01_o5.dat' u 1:7 t 'CEID 5' w lp lt 3

  Finally, you can plot the average kinetic energy (classical+quantal) of the
  ions:

    p './energies_run01_o0.dat' u 1:5 t 'CEID 0' w lp lt 1, './energies_run01_o5.dat' u 1:5 t 'CEID 5' w lp lt 3

  You can see that CEID 5 predicts "hotter" ions than CEID 0. The difference in
  kinetic energy between the two runs is due to the decrease of electronic
  potential energy during the decay (the total energy is conserved).
